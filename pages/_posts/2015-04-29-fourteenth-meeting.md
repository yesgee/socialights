## Server

* Hylke added a feature that handles the game flow automatically. We only have to ask the first question from the admin panel, and the rest of the game is on auto.

## Hue Lights

* The Hue lights have been connected to the server. Works awesome! Kudos to Jan!

## Android

* Samuel and Hylke have finished the Android App. Everything now works.
* Samuel and Harika worked on testing the App.

## Final Report

* A large part of the report is finished. Everyone should complete the missing parts before tomorrow evening.
