## Hue Lights

* The Lamps have been bought.
* Jan and Hylke will start working on connecting the Hue Lights to the server.

## Server

* Game Flow is done!
* Admin panel is awesome. You can control the entire Game Flow.
* We will create a script that populates the database with demo questions.

## Socket Client
