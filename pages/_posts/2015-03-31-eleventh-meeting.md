## Progress Meeting

Jan and Hylke had a meeting with Sakari. He liked our idea and is positive about our progress.

We have to buy table lamps, because the Hue kit only contained the lightbulbs. @yesgee will go to IKEA to buy those.

We will set up the Hue lights in the Co-Location Centre (Open Innovation House, 2nd Floor).

## Server

* We have to build the game flow and then we're done!

## Android

* There are still buttons that are doing weird things, but we expect to fix this soon.

## Timeline

* **Week 19 (4 May)**
  * **Course:** Project demonstrations
  * **Deadline:** Final report (6 May)
