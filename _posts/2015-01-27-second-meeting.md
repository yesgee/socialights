# Houm.io

Some team members are afraid that working together with Huom.io will cost a lot of time.

Let's do it anyway! Hylke, Jan and Samuel think it won't take too much time. Hylke and Jan will contact the guys after the meeting.

# Research Papers

Hylke contacted some of his friends in the Industrial Design department in Delft and received some research papers, but they're not super useful. It could be a good idea to try to contact the ID department of Aalto. Hylke and Jan will do this after the meeting.

# More Ideas

* **Parking:** A tool to help you find your car in a parking
* **Music Game**
* **Public Spaces:**
  * Bus Stops
  * Coffee Break rooms - **Good idea**
* **Quiz / Riddle**
* **Tic Tac Toe** in the coffee room --- **AWESOME!**

We're going with: **Games in the Coffee Room**

Jan's brothers are in the field of Game Design, maybe they have more cool ideas.

# Project Plan

We will hopefully hear something about this tomorrow.
