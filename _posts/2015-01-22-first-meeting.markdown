# Brainstorm

* **Music:** Jan and Hylke were thinking of a system that links the lighting to music or a rhythm that can be set using the phone. This could be used to set a certain mood for the situation. Similar applications already exist, except that those applications are linked to the phone's microphone, but these don't really perform well.
* **Notifications:** User gets phone notifications through changing lights.
* **Cars:** Signaling between cars
* **Light Game:** Chasing lights
* **Wake up alarm:** Like the Philips Wakeup light
* **Shop lighting:** Help customers in a shop find the right product
* **Interior design:** Decorate a house with different themes/moods
* **Art:** Paint light across the room with the g-sensor of your phone
* **Restaurants:** Instead of candles, use LED lights to personalize your table
* **Communication:** Like Li-Fi
* **Puzzle**
* **Education**
* **Guess the picture:** One person sets a picture, other person has to guess
* **Safety:** Kitchen, stove is still on.
* **Long distance relationship lamp**
* **Is the sauna warm enough?**
* **Visual Timer:** How long do I have for breakfast?
* **Indoor navigation**
* **Shoes / Wearables**
