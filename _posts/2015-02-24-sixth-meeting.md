# Server Development

We have set up a skeleton for the server. We're using [Actionhero](http://www.actionherojs.com/) as a basis for our server.

* Development is done with [Atom](https://atom.io/).
  * Use the plugins ``editorconfig``, ``linter``, ``linter-jshint`` and ``linter-jscs``.
* Testing is done on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/mobi-led/socialights-server).

Getting started:

```
git clone git@github.com:mobi-led/socialights-server.git
cd socialights-server
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

Please make sure you work in feature branches: ``feature/name-of-your-feature``.

Hylke and Jan will work on the server on Thursday.

# Android Development
