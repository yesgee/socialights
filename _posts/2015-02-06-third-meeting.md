# Game Idea
Since we will probably only have three lights to work with, we are going to forfeit the idea of Tic-Tac-Toe and are going to go with with the idea of making a coffee room quiz game, much like [Quiz clash](http://http://www.quizclash-game.com/).
We can make it a team game, where every team has their own light, and one light is used for countdown/scoring purposes. For every team a light will roll a certain colour and at the countdown, the person corresponding to that colour will have to answer a question.

# Other ideas

* **Maze/Block colouring:** might be too complicated for a 5 min game
* **Lights change, do something**
* **Spin the bottle**
* **Truth/dare/do task**: Lights can indicate a person that has to do a truth or dare, or that has to do a task that people have voted on to be funny
* **Questionnaire**: Answer questions about yourself/others or answer questions about the company
* **Pointing game**: Who do you think is most likely to [blank]/has the most [blank]?
* **Coffee meter/free coffee**: measure how much coffee everyone drank/give out free coffee to people winning small games


#Cloud company
We should contact the company about cooperation and get more lights from them. We can adjust the idea for the quiz-game to work with the cloud software by making a quiz-competition between competing companies. ("*Let's beat the guys at **Microsoft** today!*")
