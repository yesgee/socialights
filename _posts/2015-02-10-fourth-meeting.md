# Project

We're building a **Quiz App** that lets people in **coffee rooms** play quizes within a coffee room or **between separate coffee rooms**. The Hue lights indicate the score, the current team, the person who has to answer the question, the time left and other information.

In the coffee room are several Hue Lights and a Hue Bridge, which is connected to the Hue Cloud. The App has to figure out in which coffee room it is (based on WiFi Network, Colour code, QR Code, whatever ...).

There are two teams, either in the same coffee room or in different coffee rooms. There is a light that indicates which team member has to answer the question. There is a light that indicates the time left (colour, blinking speed).
