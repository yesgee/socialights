## Introduction

In large companies and organisations employees often don't know many of their colleagues except for their direct co-workers. During their breaks, they get a cup of coffee and return to their office. This leaves the coffee rooms empty and unattractive and doesn't lead to any social interaction between co-workers. We plan to build an application that makes these coffee rooms more attractive by enabling employees to interact with the room and with each other in a playful way. This increases social interaction and collaboration between co-workers, which are desirable feats within a company.

Our App provides a quiz-based game that can be played with two teams in the same coffee room, but also between two teams in two separate coffee rooms (on different floors or office locations, for example). Participants have to collaborate with each other to find the answers to the questions and the lights in the coffee room provide feedback for the game. This visual stimulation will tempt other people in the room to also participate.

## Evaluation of the results

> Evaluating the achievement of the project goals. Discuss reasons if some goals were changed/not achieved.

The main goal of this project is to build an application that is able to bring colleagues together within a company and make them get to know and understand each other. With *SociaLights*, we strive to enhance social interaction between people and, by doing so, strengthen the social foundation of the companies that adopt *SociaLights*. We believe that a cooperative and playful game in the coffee room will lead to the development of social ties and cooporative skills that contribute to future (collaborative) problem solving capabilities of the company.
Our secondary goal is to make the game, combined with lights, into a *cool* gadget, such that young and vibrant companies will sooner be tempted to acquire the lights and the application.

In the project we build a quiz game and made it work for deployment in **one coffee room**. We have build the mobile (Android) application and a cloud-based game server. We depend on a third party service (Hue Cloud) to communicate with the Hue Lights.

### Acheived Goals 

* We have build a quiz application on android platform that enables user to join a game and play
* A quiz server that  generates the question and sends to the application
* Hue lights are connected to the server

### Scope for improvement 

 In the project implemented only the quiz game, but we keep the possibility to add more game types later.
We also limit ourselves to one coffee room here and there is scope to make it work between multiple coffee rooms. 

### Other results 
> Discussion of all other project results, not included in the evaluated goals.

### Evaluation of quality of the system

> Evaluation of the quality of the developed system based on achievement of the quality goals, quality metrics, group's opinion etc.
> Known bugs, unfinished features, prospective development ideas.

** Server **

Hylke and Jan can look into this

** UI **

* The User Interface is simple and user friendly. The application guides the user from the start of the game till the end.
* The user is given the freedom to join any of the teams he likes to
* Unfinished feature: Timer

Sowmya and Gayathri can add more points


** Android-Server Connectivity **
Samuel and Harika can look into this.

** Hue lights **

### Challenging Technological and Environment Aspects

** Technological Aspects **
* To work with Hue lights and establish the connectivity with the server
*
Everyone can add things

> List of all challenging technological and environment related aspects of the project that you want the tutor to consider when he evaluates the project's difficulty.

** Environment Aspects **
* Coffee rooms and deploying it
* Blinking lights in a manner that does not have a disturbing effect on the user

## Metrics

> Summary of used resources, quality metrics, software size etc. Some analysis of the figures compared to your previous projects or other similar projects.

Everyone must look into this

## Work practices and tools

> Experiences of the used practices and tools. Discussion of their suitability to your project. Which were the Top-3 or Top-X useful and useless ones?

Everyone can look into it

## Preliminary business model

> A short (1-2 pages) business model design based on the STOF framework. A description of STOF can be found from here: https://noppa.aalto.fi/noppa/kurssi/t-109.4300/luennot/T-109_4300_slides_3.pdf. Include a hypothetical deployment plan as well into this section (i.e., how you would launch your application).

Sowmya and Harika will work on this. 

## Grade adjustment

> At the end of the project each group member can evaluate each other's contribution, and propose personal increases and decreases of one grade (the sum of these must be zero). We recommend the group to have an open discussion within the group about the evaluations and make a combined proposal of changes either in this section or separately to the tutor. If this is not possible, each member can confidentially send their proposal to the tutor. Based on the proposal the course personnel may tune the personal grades by one. If all group members would get grade 5 without raises, proposed deductions are neglected. In addition, proposed grade changes won’t cause anyone to fail the course if the group’s grade was 1 or pass the course if the group’s grade was 0. Even if the group does not want to tune the grades, it is recommended that the group members internally give feedback to the other members of their success in their role: what was good, what good have been done better.
