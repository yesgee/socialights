## Introduction

In large companies and organisations employees often don't know many of their colleagues except for their direct co-workers. During their breaks, they get a cup of coffee and return to their office. This leaves the coffee rooms empty and unattractive and doesn't lead to any social interaction between co-workers. We plan to build an application that makes these coffee rooms more attractive by enabling employees to interact with the room and with each other in a playful way. This increases social interaction and collaboration between co-workers, which are desirable feats within a company.

Our App provides a quiz-based game that can be played with two teams in the same coffee room, but also between two teams in two separate coffee rooms (on different floors or office locations, for example). Participants have to collaborate with each other to find the answers to the questions and the lights in the coffee room provide feedback for the game. This visual stimulation will tempt other people in the room to also participate.

## Evaluation of the results

> Evaluating the achievement of the project goals. Discuss reasons if some goals were changed/not achieved.
> Discussion of all other project results, not included in the evaluated goals.
> Evaluation of the quality of the developed system based on achievement of the quality goals, quality metrics, group's opinion etc.
> Known bugs, unfinished features, prospective development ideas.
> List of all challenging technological and environment related aspects of the project that you want the tutor to consider when he evaluates the project's difficulty.

## Metrics

> Summary of used resources, quality metrics, software size etc. Some analysis of the figures compared to your previous projects or other similar projects.

## Work practices and tools

> Experiences of the used practices and tools. Discussion of their suitability to your project. Which were the Top-3 or Top-X useful and useless ones?

## Preliminary business model

> A short (1-2 pages) business model design based on the STOF framework. A description of STOF can be found from here: https://noppa.aalto.fi/noppa/kurssi/t-109.4300/luennot/T-109_4300_slides_3.pdf. Include a hypothetical deployment plan as well into this section (i.e., how you would launch your application).

## Grade adjustment

> At the end of the project each group member can evaluate each other's contribution, and propose personal increases and decreases of one grade (the sum of these must be zero). We recommend the group to have an open discussion within the group about the evaluations and make a combined proposal of changes either in this section or separately to the tutor. If this is not possible, each member can confidentially send their proposal to the tutor. Based on the proposal the course personnel may tune the personal grades by one. If all group members would get grade 5 without raises, proposed deductions are neglected. In addition, proposed grade changes won’t cause anyone to fail the course if the group’s grade was 1 or pass the course if the group’s grade was 0. Even if the group does not want to tune the grades, it is recommended that the group members internally give feedback to the other members of their success in their role: what was good, what good have been done better.
